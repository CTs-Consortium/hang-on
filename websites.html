    <h2>The Coding CAT</h2>
    <p>
      Here is where you can find a collecion of my web work. The first wabe page
      is a project that I worked on and completed while learning the ins and
      outs of HTML and CSS web design. The project is titled "Omnifood", and it
      is a real world website for a not-so-real business. The purpose was to
      learn functionality and apply the skills learned in the course.
