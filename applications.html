    <h2>CAT's Content Creation</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to my content hub!
      <br />
      <br />
      If you enjoy gaming as much as I do, this is for you! I'm a PC and Switch
      gamer, a part-time content creator, and lover of MOST things competitive.
      I have no shame in saying, that even though I love all genres of gaming
      and will play almost anything at least once, I'm guilty of playing the
      same games in rotation for months on end. a PRIME example is Apex Legends.
      As of 2/7/22, I've invested three years into that particular game. If you
      play, you know why. If you dont play, I suggest you get into the action,
      you wont be disappointed!
    </p>

        >My YouTube Channel</a
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      At this point, you'll probably only see live streams on my channel. At one
      point, I was creating content from scratch for Apex Legends and a few
      other games. I steered away from that due to lack of time and the fact
      that I wanted to learn to code in order to change careers, but the gaming
      never left! So instead of focusing on CREATING content, I can give it to
      you live, and still have time to focus on the
      <strong>IMPORTANT</strong> things.

      In addition to gaming, you will also be able to find videos related to my
      web development journey. Initially, it will be mostly time-lapse videos of
      my websited being built. The biggest reason for making them is to document
      my journey, but I also know that YouTube is the place where people go to
      learn something on the fly, so if my videos can help someone else out by
      showing them something they didnt know, or helping them work out a bug in
      their code, GREAT! I'm far from being the most proficient coder you know,
      but in the future I would like to make small tutorial videos for people
      like my PRESENT day self (2/7/22) who need help.
